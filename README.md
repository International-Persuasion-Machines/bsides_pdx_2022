# IPM / BSides PDX 2022

This talk is based off of a post about [reverse engineering WAFs](https://www.ipm-corporation.com/research/reverse-engineering-how-the-waf-industry-identifies-bots) and uses a dataset sourced from [a survey of bot vulnerabilities on US retailer websites](https://www.ipm-corporation.com/research/surveying-the-bot-manipulation-landscape-among-top-us-retailers).

Three files for your consumption:

* IPM BSidesPDX Talk.pdf - slides for the talk
* test.ado - replication steps in STATA, will require installing `domin` ([link](https://github.com/jluchman/domin)) via `ssc`
* waf_test_dataset.csv - dataset used in the talk, anonymized.
